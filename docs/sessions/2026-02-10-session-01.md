# Session 01 — Feb 10, 2026

## Summary
Full build-out of VV Nano from initial Vite scaffold to a rich multi-page prototype with portal management, search, notifications, account settings, and pinned URL rendering.

## What Was Built

### Pages & Views
1. **Home (Empty State)** — Energy orb SVG with aggressive morphing animation, "Welcome to VV Nano", Start Setup button, disconnected status readout
2. **Home (Connected State)** — 2-column portal thumbnail grid with fake browser chrome previews, hover "Open Portal" overlay, "Add Portal" card, connected status bar
3. **Search** — Pre-search hero with large search bar, typeahead dropdown by first letter, filter pills (Vehicles, Faults, Drivers, etc.), post-search 2-column layout with result cards + AI assistant side panel
4. **Notifications** — 8 mock notifications with critical/alert/warning/info types, read/unread toggle, severity filters, mark all read, AI Summary sidebar with priority insights
5. **Account** — 5-tab layout with secondary sidebar:
   - Profile (name, company, email with verified chip, theme toggle, keyboard shortcuts, delete account)
   - Sign-in Methods (email connected, Google/passkeys/GitHub to connect)
   - Two-Factor Auth (authenticator app, SMS, recovery codes)
   - Billing (Pro plan card, Visa payment, billing history table)
   - Usage (token stats, progress bar, weekly + monthly bar charts)
6. **Settings** — Theme mode picker (dark/light/system) with miniature UI swatches, portal management (edit/delete/add)
7. **Pinned URL Pages** — Sidebar items render URLs in iframes with browser-chrome frame

### Infrastructure
- **Password gate** — `Surf&sn0w`, sessionStorage-based
- **Shared portal state** — Lifted to App, used by ContentFrame + SettingsView
- **Add Portal Modal** — Glass overlay shared between home and settings
- **Pinned pages** — Separate from portals, sidebar items with overflow menus (open in new tab, remove)
- **Animation system** — 20+ keyframe animations, stagger classes, micro-interactions (press-scale, hover-lift)
- **Vercel deployment** — Auto-deploy from main, password-protected

### Accent Color Migration
Swapped entire project from `#00f0ff` cyan to `#30BAFF` blue — both hex references and rgba values.

### Logo
Composed Virtual Vehicle wordmark SVG from 17 individual Figma vector exports using a bash script. Fixed broken `d="Vector"` attribute issue by extracting actual path data.

## Key Decisions
- **Single-file architecture** — All components in App.tsx for vibe speed. Will decompose when porting to Electron.
- **No router library** — String-based `activePage` state is sufficient for prototype.
- **No state management** — Plain `useState`, state lifted to App where needed.
- **CSS animations over JS** — Keyframes in index.css for performance and simplicity.
- **Portals vs Pinned Pages** — Two separate concepts: portals are "connected services" (home grid), pinned pages are "sidebar shortcuts" with URLs.

## Known Issues / Future Work
- iframes may be blocked by X-Frame-Options on some URLs (expected for auth pages)
- Theme mode toggle is visual only (doesn't actually switch themes yet)
- "More" button in sidebar is not wired
- Portal thumbnails are fake previews (not real screenshots)
- No persistence — portals and pinned pages reset on page reload
- Search, notifications, and billing data are all mocked
- BrowserControls URL bar is static (doesn't reflect active page URL)
